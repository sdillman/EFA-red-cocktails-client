Repo for the client side of the _Let's Talk COCKTAILS!_ capstone project for Eleven Fifty Academy, inspired by someone who wants ideas for new cocktails to play with, and wants to share with his friends. This is a full-stack PERN school project at the time of writing, October 2021. There are many enhancements I'd like to make when school is done and I have time. I am happy to hear issues and ideas.

This project draws upon [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/), which I am grateful for and which I am pleased to offer my support. They have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/thedatadb).

### ‚ú® [Demo](https://sd-efa-red-lets-talk-cocktails.herokuapp.com)

## Install

* Depends on [EFA-red-cocktails-server](https://github.com/sdillman/EFA-red-cocktails-server), which should be installed first.

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm start
```

Push the button to display a random cocktail. 

Not what you're looking for? Button mash some more.

Find something interesting? Add it to your collection!

You will be prompted to either log in or create an account. Do whichever you need to do, and save your cocktail. You will be able to edit it (soon), delete it, etc. You can leave comments, on your own and on others'. And you can view your collection.

Very basic for now, but as I have time I'd like to make this a lot more user friendly, and make it a fun way for Tom and his buddies to share and get inspired. Eventually, I hope others enjoy it as well.
